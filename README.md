As part of my Google Business Intelligence certification, I developed a project to analyze the sales trends of an e-commerce company.

I used [Google Data Studio] to create interactive dashboards that would enable managers to make data-driven decisions.

One of the biggest challenges was cleaning and transforming a very large and complex dataset.

In the end, I was able to identify seasonal buying patterns and segment customers based on their behavior, which allowed the company to launch more effective marketing campaigns.

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization, and prepared me to take on data analytics roles in companies in any industry.
